Reverse engineer this binary using Ghidra and retrieve the flag string at the end of execution.

*Private note: This challenge is not very sophisticated. I simply made several obfuscation functions and called them several times. This is more of a rat maze than anything. I did alternate between passing the flag variable by reference using C++'s syntactic sugar and returning a value.*
