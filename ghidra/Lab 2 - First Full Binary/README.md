# Lab 2 - First Full Binary

`TODO: Figure out how to stop the compiler from optimizing the code. It's stripping away the extra characters at the end of the "prefix" variable. Also, confirm everything is working as expected`

In the previous challenge, the provided binary had been stripped down to the bytecode of a single function. When compiling with a compiler such as gcc or g++, there is a substantial amount of extra bytecode added to the binary. This is a good thing, because it adds protections against common attacks, such as buffer overflows. However, it does complicate the binary. In this challenge, you will be working on a full binary. Since no bytecode has been removed from the binary, Ghidra should be able to identify it by itself. Correctly identify and submit the flag string to complete the challenge. Good luck!
